# Sign Recognition Using CNN and OpenCV

## Project Overview
This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and OpenCV to create a real-time sign language recognition system. It's designed to bridge the communication gap for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community by translating sign language gestures into text or speech. Our goal is to enhance accessibility and interaction within digital spaces.

## Features
- **Real-Time Detection**: Captures live video streams from a webcam for gesture recognition.
- **High Accuracy**: Utilizes a pre-trained CNN model for accurate sign language gesture classification.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy to use with a straightforward interface for all users.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Pip Package Manager

### Dependencies
Install the necessary libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras opencv-python numpy
```
Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-recognition-cnn-opencv.git
cd sign-recognition-cnn-opencv
```

### Usage
To launch the sign recognition application, execute:
```bash
python main.py
```
Ensure your gestures are within the webcam's field of view. The system will recognize and display the corresponding sign interpretations in real-time.
